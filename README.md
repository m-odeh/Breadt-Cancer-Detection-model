# Breast-Cancer-Detection-model
This model will predict if someone have breast cancer based on the test results
The test results: 
- Clump Thickness
- uniform Cell Size
- Uniform Cell Shape
- Marginal Adhesion 
- Signle Epithelial_size
- Bare Nuclei
- Bland Chromatin
- Normal Nucleoli
- Mitoses
- Class

By training two models: Support Vector Machine (SVM) & K Nearest Neighbour (KNN), the models will try to predict if a patient has breast cancer or not.

First step before building the models is to import, visualize, and clean the data so that we understand it well, and to make sure all the data is valid and no missing data.

Second step is to build the SVM and KNN models and train each model using the training data.

Third step is to evaluate each model by getting the accuracy score and classification report.
